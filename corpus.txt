I went back and paid for them. All that matters is 
that Steven is happy. Pay attention to these petals, 
Steven. The petals' dance seems improvised, but it 
is being calculated in real time based on the 
physical properties of this planet. With hard work 
and dedication, you can master the magical 
properties of your gem and perform your own dance! 
Some of us are trying to protect humanity! Don't 
touch those, their shards are deadly! Oh, Amethyst, 
there you are. Care to explain what one of my swords 
was doing in your room? Oh, please, you took it! 
These shards have a powerful partial consciousness 
that has been harnessed by gems throughout history 
in order to create semi-sentient drone soldiers with 
the capacity to follow basic orders. Gems once 
created an army of these drones, but found their 
obedience waned as the shards overdeveloped inside 
their uniforms and turned on their commanders. You 
see, any shard inside any sort of container could 
become a monster! Weren't people scared of it before 
it attacked them? Put your clothes on, Steven. This 
just goes to show that you should always listen to 
me, and never listen to Amethyst. Let's set up a 
playdate! I'll write up an invitation and work out a 
schedule. Oh! We'll have to find out her favorite 
kind of tea. I misunderstood the point of this ride. 
Steven, what have I told you about touching magical 
artifacts?! We want to stop all wrestling 
everywhere! Are you going to let us destroy all 
wrestling? Eheheh. Humans find such fascinating ways 
to waste their time. Is water just hydrogen and 
oxygen "mashed together"? Well, that's perfect, 
because I don't want to go with grammatically 
incorrect people anyway. GAH! You will remove that 
this instant! You have to feel like yourself! Sweet 
and considerate, and only occasionally obnoxious! I 
can't leave you guys alone for a second. Oh, walk it 
off! With pleasure. There are... different ways of 
being strong. Just today you were crying about 
snakes. AMETHYST, NO ROUGHHOUSING! YOU'LL EXACERBATE 
YOUR CRACK!! Oh, how do I put this? All Gems aren't 
necessarily... good. Wikia: Steven Universe Fan App

Fryman: You were great, Frybo. The kids today just 
didn't understand. Now, they never will. Weren't 
people scared of it before it attacked them? Steven: 
Pearl, I think our work here is done. Put your 
clothes on, Steven. This just goes to show that you 
should always listen to me, and never listen to 
Amethyst. Amethyst: That's fair. Let's set up a 
playdate! I'll write up an invitation and work out a

Steven, what have I told you about touching magical 
artifacts?! "Serious Steven" We want to stop all 
wrestling everywhere! Are you going to let us 
destroy all wrestling? Eheheh. Humans find such 
fascinating ways to waste their time. Is water just 
hydrogen and oxygen "mashed together"? Amethyst: 
Well, I'm going with not Pearl. Well, that's 
perfect, because I don't want to go with 
grammatically incorrect people anyway. GAH! You will 
remove that this instant! You have to feel like 
yourself! Sweet and considerate, and only 
occasionally obnoxious! I can't leave you guys alone 
for a second. Amethyst: *innocently* Pearl, I got a 
boo-boo. Oh, walk it off! Nanefua Pizza: Hit 
Amethyst into the air as hard as you can! With 
pleasure. There are... different ways of being 
strong. Steven: I guess I'm just too tough to cry. 
Just today you were crying about snakes. Steven: 
They don't have any arms! AMETHYST, NO ROUGHHOUSING! 
YOU'LL EXACERBATE YOUR CRACK!! "An Indirect Kiss" 
Oh, how do I put this? All Gems aren't 
necessarily... good. Amethyst: All those monsters we 
fight used to be just like us! Right, Pearl? Yes. 
But they've become corrupted and broken. We have to 
take care of them, subdue them, contain them. It's 
the best we can do for them, for now. If we don't, 
then... Ugh... I hate fighting me! 'UUU Space 
Travel?' What is this? I hear what you're saying, 
and I agree - it would be incredibly dangerous; a 
fool's errand. This chair is disgusting. But aren't 
the true fools the ones who don't seize an 
opportunity, despite all the inherent risks? And I'd 
be able to show Steven the wonders of the cosmos! 
And maybe just for a second, from a distance, I 
could see what's been going on without me. All 
right! Lets do it! This will be perfectly fine, just 
a pop over to the nearest star system. I'll give him 
back in 50 years. I'm so sorry... I almost got us 
killed! Humans just lead short, boring, 
insignificant lives, so they make up stories to feel 
like they're a part of something bigger. They want 
to blame all the world's problems on some single 
enemy they can fight, instead of a complex network 
of interrelated forces beyond anyone's control. Why 
does it have to be dinner? We get all the energy we 
need from our gems, and while our human constructs 
are capable of eating, I find it very uncomfortable. 
Let go of my spear, you little twerps. I'll destroy 
you! I like to watch you sleep sometimes. And by 
sometimes, I mean often. Oh, Steven, you're supposed 
to sneeze into your antecubital fossa. I hope you 
can forgive me. You're the one good thing that came 
out of this mess, I always thought you were proud of 
that.
Stop... coming... here... you... STUPID... BALLS!
No! Rose didn't have a lion!
Everything I ever did, I did for her. And now she's gone. But I'm still here.
I can't believe my flipping eyes!
That could have gone... a lot worse.
You always say you'll be the crocodile, but you never commit!
I don't understand your human relationships. So, um... goodbye!
WE'LL NEVER ESCAPE, THIS IS OUR NEW HOME!
I'M NOT OVERREACTING!
That's not my baby!
Have the shirts come to life and possessed the bodies of their wearers?!
Are the shirts destroying the wearer's will to continue on in this mortal coil, thereby shutting down Beach City?!
Do you understand that cartoon show?
WHY WON'T YOU JUST LET ME DO THIS FOR YOU, ROSE!?
Rose made me feel... like I was everything.
Her fingers were too fast for us!
Listen, Mr. Universe. Rose may find you charming, but that's only because you're human. You're a novelty, at best.
I think he's her favorite too.
I don't get tired; I get results.
No! No, no, no, no! We just needed a reason to fuse! I just wanted to share a few more victories with you!
I am a gem of many talents. A dedication to fact is just one of them.
Oh, what's 200 years between friends?
Look! I was right! My plan worked perfectly.
That's it, I'm taking her out!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!
Okay, I realize that was a bit of a fiasco.
It's Peridot.
Ha! She's desperate.
Excellent question, Steven!
Peridot is running out of options!
Ah yes! The task at hand! No more dawdling, let's go catch Peridot!
Please! Tell me! How can I make you forgive me!?
But it's true. No matter how hard I try to be strong like you... I'm just a Pearl... I'm useless on my own... I need someone to tell me what to do... When we fuse, I can feel what it's like to be you..! Confident and secure and complete... You're perfect... You're the perfect relationship... You're always together... I justâ€”I wanted to be a part of that...
Well, yes. What other option do we have? Keep her outside on a leash? Ha ha... Hmm...
Ugh... sorry, Steven, it's a lovely drawing but it won't look like this.
NOBODY!
Now listen here, you tiny twerp! In case you've forgotten, you're on our turf now! And I didn't fight a thousand-year war for this planet's independence to take orders from the likes of you!
Mine's taller. I win.
That's right! I am a pearl!
What you're saying may be true, but it doesn't matter! I'm still gonna kick your butt!
You're holding it upside down.
They're called wheels.
Peridot, if you can get the magnetron out of that microwave, we'll have everything we need... except for the drill head.
We leave for one second and everything goes off the rails!
